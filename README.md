# Internet_Programing_FESB
Welcome to my repository of Internet programing. These are some tasks that I solved from my college course.

Here are some tasks that Ive solved in my college course. I was using the HTML, CSS, php... these are not my prefferences
of languages but I am always ready to learn something new and expand my knowledge. I also made a project called Facebook 2.0
after all the tasks fell free to visit.
